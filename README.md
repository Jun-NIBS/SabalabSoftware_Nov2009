# SabalabSoftware_Nov2009

This is an "as is" version of all the software we use for 2-phton and electrophysiology data acquisition.
Better docs and organization will come with time.

This is MATLAB code. We typically run it with 2009b. There are sligth issues with newer versions. 
It requires the legacy data acquisition toolbox, which limits use to 32 bit MATLAB. 
We are porting to 64 bit and the new toolbox design now.
